# Introduction-to-Data-Science-in-Python
"Introduction to Data Science in Python" is a part of "Applied Data Science with Python Specialization" offered by University of Michigan on Coursera.

The course introduces data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.

In this repository, I'll share the course contents, solutions to the weekly assignments, the datasets and also the in video quizzes.
